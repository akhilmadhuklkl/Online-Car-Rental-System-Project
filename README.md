# Online Car Rental System Project

The project entitled "ONLINE CAR RENTAL SYSTEM" is to design & create an Online Car Rental Portal to allow customers to enter their details, search for the cars in their location, specify the time period for the number of days of using the car, & also view the orders they made It also allows for the creation of new car dealers by entering their details & adding cars into their database by mentioning the car name, car image, car location, rent price per day, view the customer orders, and also the earnings made from all orders. Our Online Car Rental System allows us to connect to multiple car dealers & helps in providing the best cars to the customers in their specified location.
